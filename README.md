# SysInfo-TGBot

A python script let you control your server with telegram bot.

## Requirements

- python 3.5
- psutil
- pyTelegramBotAPI

## Usage

1. Modify `TOKEN` and `ChatID` to your own botâ€˜s information, change `Password` to your system user's password (system service needs privilege).

   - Modify `WaitSec` if you want to wait longer/shorter before rebooting (default is 10 seconds).
   - Modify `BOT_INFO` to your own info message.

2. Then run

   ```shell
   python3 run.py
   ```

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 home server, Ubuntu 16.04 VPS.

**Notice:**

1. This script can't directly run on Windows since psutil can't detect sensors' temperature on Windows platform. You need to comment out the `get_CPU_Core_Temp()` function.
2. System service function requires the `systemctl` command.
3. Now it's recommended to use the script as system service instead of adding `&` in CLI, since it has the `while True` part.
   - I added `while True` due to the unstable connection to *api.telegram.org* in my area, if you do not have this problem then delete it.
4. Since cloud platforms are using virtual machine to provide service, the CPU core temperature function may not working if you are using VPS. This may leads to a bot polling failure and the script will sleep for 15s.
   - Prevent this by comment out the `res = get_CPU_Core_Temp()` line.
